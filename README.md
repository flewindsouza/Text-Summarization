# Text-Summarization
Using NLTK

The NLTK library uses cosine sililarity for summarisation of document. Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. To find the similarity among sentences, we consider the measures of cosine of the angle between vectors. If sentences are similar, the angle will be 0.
